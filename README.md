### Week 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

For the first challenge I used HTML and .css to refactor a webpage.
In order to optimize SEO and increase accessibility, semantic tags were used to accomplish this.
The following criteria were used to guide the refactor process:


```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

I used .css to style the navigation bar. ![navbar](/assets/images/navbar.png)

I used HTML to sort content into sections using semantic element tags. ![sections](/assets/images/sections.png)


This site was refactored using [GitHub Pages](https://mckeags7.github.io/Horiseon/)
